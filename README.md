# robotic-arm-mdu/README.md
These files are intended for future development by students. CAD files (Solidworks extensions) that contain all parts from the summer course in robotics.

Contains a linkage-driven anthropomorphic robotic arm with one servo actuation per finger. The idea is to use threads through screw loops attached to bearing linkages to push the finger phalanx joint by servos pulling the thread.
Also contains a rotational wrist and attachments to an already existing elbow part.

Pins to attach the finger parts are included and can be printed as well.
